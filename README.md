# ObjectDetection
Object Detection using YOLO and OpenCV.
In this repository, I built a streamlit app for Object Detection, for both Video Object Detection and Image Object Detection.

The Video , Images, Detected Videos, Detected Images used  can be found in the Gallery directory.

This YOLO object Detection project can detect 80 objects(i.e classes) in either a video or image. 
The full list of the classes can be found in the labels directory as a textfile.
Since a pretrained Model is made use of, the Yolo.v3 configuration can be found in the config_n_weights directory.
YOLO.v3 weights is very heavy, about 200mb and should be downloaded online.

Below are few of the Object Detected Images and Videos.
Enjoy.
